# Python tutorial
This content will instruct users on working with Jisc/HESA Data Collection and Statistics: Data &amp; Innovation data in Python.

The intention is not to replicate the thousands of basic Python tutorials, [Jisc even have their own](https://github.com/JiscDACT/PositivelySkewed). The code in this repo should be specifically tailored to working with D&I data.

:warning:**Important**:warning:

No data should be uploaded to this repo. Additionally, any screenshots should **not** contain data, real or otherwise. Usernames should also be suppressed.

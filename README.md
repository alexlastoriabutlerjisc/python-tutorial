# Python tutorial
This content will instruct users on working with Jisc/HESA Data Collection and Statistics: Data &amp; Innovation data in Python.

The intention is not to replicate the thousands of basic Python tutorials, [Jisc even have their own](https://github.com/JiscDACT/PositivelySkewed). The code in this repo should be specifically tailored to working with D&I data.

No data should be uploaded to this repo. Additionally, any screenshots should **not** contain data, real or otherwise. Usernames and connections to databases should also be suppressed.

## Coverage
In time, this tutorial will contain content for the following, based on real use cases within D&I:
1. Introduction to Data Analysis:
   - Overview of popular Python libraries for data analysis, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
   - How to install and import these libraries in a Python environment.

2. Data Loading and Exploration:
   - How to load various data formats (CSV, JSON, Excel) using Pandas.
   - Essential Pandas functions for data exploration, such as head(), tail(), describe(), info(), and shape.
   - How to handle missing data and perform basic data cleaning tasks.

3. Data Manipulation and Transformation:
   - Fundamental data manipulation operations, including selecting columns, filtering rows, and sorting data.
   - How to perform data transformations like adding new columns, merging datasets, and reshaping data using Pandas.

5. Aggregation and Summary Statistics:
   - Aggregation operations in Pandas, such as groupby() and pivot_table(), to calculate summary statistics.
   - How to calculate common metrics like mean, median, mode, count, and standard deviation.

6. Data Analysis Techniques:
   - Hypothesis testing and statistical analysis using libraries like SciPy and StatsModels.
   - How to conduct t-tests, chi-square tests, and correlation analysis to draw meaningful conclusions from data.

7. Data Visualization:
   - How to create different types of plots, such as line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
   - How to customize plot aesthetics, add labels and titles, and save plots to files.
